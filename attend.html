              From the Schiphol airport, it is easy to get to Amsterdam or the venue (the Science Park station) by train, as the train station is located on the bottom floor of the airport lobby.
              If you stay in a hotel in Amsterdam, you can go to the venue in many different ways.

              or on foot.
              So journeys are short, pleasant, and enlightening.
              For trains, you can use the <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en">NS train offical website</a> (or their app) to plan routes and buy tickets.
              Alternatively, you can also use the ticket machine to buy paper tickets at train stations.
              If you prefer to travel by taxi, you can use the Uber app to plan the route, call taxi drivers, and pay the cost using online payment methods.
              At train stations, you can rent bikes, and the Netherlands has decent bike lane planning for very nice biking experiences.
