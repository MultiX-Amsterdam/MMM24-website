              While MMM 2024 will be broadcast online for registered participants, the conference will primarily be an onsite event.
              In particular, presenting authors of all oral presentations are expected to attend the conference on location.
              Posters will be presented in hybrid onsite/online sessions, so virtual poster presentations will be possible.

              So journeys are short, pleasant, and enlightening.
              You can rent bikes at train stations, and the Netherlands has decent bike lane planning for very nice biking experiences.
              For trains, you can use the <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en">NS train offical website</a> (or their app) to plan routes and buy tickets.
              It is also easy to get to Amsterdam from the airport by train, as the train station is located on the bottom floor of the airport lobby.
              For taxis, you can use the Uber app to plan the route, call taxi drivers, and pay the cost using online payment methods.
