            The conference accepts 5 types of contributions:
            <ul>
              <li>Regular papers, describing novel results in the conference research topics</li>
              <li>Special session papers, describing novel results that are focused on selected narrow topics</li>
              <li>Video Browser Showdown (VBS) papers for the video browsing contest attendees</li>
              <li>Demo papers, giving an overview of new interesting software or methods</li>
              <li>Brave New Ideas</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">
              All paper submissions must conform to <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">the formatting instructions</a> of Springer Verlag, LNCS series, and must strictly adhere to the submission schedule.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Each contribution (regular, special session, VBS, demo paper, etc.) must be associated with one full conference registration; only one contribution can be associated with each registration.
              While MMM 2024 will be broadcast online for registered participants, the conference will primarily be an onsite event.
              In particular, presenting authors of all oral presentations are expected to attend the conference on location.
              Posters will be presented in hybrid onsite/online sessions, so virtual poster presentations will be possible.

            </p>
            <p class="text">
              An additional 1-2 pages should be appended to your paper illustrating what will be shown at the demo session at MMM. This additional content will not be published in the conference proceedings, should the submission be accepted. We also recommend including a URL linking to a short video (max. 3 min) to accompany the paper that shows the demo in action.
            </p>
              <p class="text">
              Presenters are expected to bring the necessary equipment (computers, etc.) themselves. The conference will provide a table, power outlet, wireless (shared) internet and a poster board.

The submission should include a detailed description of the video search tool (including a screenshot) and how it supports interactive search in video data. Submissions will be peer-reviewed to ensure maximum quality. Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the MMM conference. In the public VBS session, each system needs to be presented (typically as a concise introductory video, or sometimes as a poster – but this will depend on the local situation and announced a few weeks before the competition).

              Thank you for your time and effort in reviewing for MMM 2024. Your expertise directly contributes to maintaining the high quality of the MMM conference series and strengthening the multimedia research community.
            </p>
              <p class="text">
                  As a Technical Program Committee (TPC) member, we expect that you are already experienced with writing excellent
                  reviews. However, in practice we find that guidelines can help the review process and the most important of our
                  guidelines are:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    You should write a review that you would like to receive yourself. Your reviews should be helpful to the authors,
                      even if the review recommends the rejection of the paper.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    The MMM conference deals with multimedia and as such, while single media papers are acceptable, papers dealing with
                      multimedia data are especially welcome.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Papers do not need to be focused on applying AI techniques to multimedia data. Our research community is rich and
                      diverse, and papers addressing many aspects of multimedia analytics and modeling are welcome.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Even though all reviews are anonymous, we hope that you prepare excellent reviews, reviews that you would be proud to
                      associate with your name.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
              <p class="text">We now present our guideline for best practices when reviewing for MMM 2024.</p>

              <h2 class="add-top-margin-small">Best practices for reviewing</h2>
              <hr/>
              <p class="text"><strong>1.
                    Check the paper topic:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Confirm that the paper that you are reviewing falls into the topical scope of MMM, as defined by the Call for Papers.
                      Eventually, we rely on your judgement and the collective wisdom with your peers to decide if the paper aligns
                      with multimedia topics.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Remember that the problem addressed by an MMM paper ideally involves multi-modal data, or is expected to be related to
                      the challenge of how people interpret and use multimedia.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Although many submissions to MMM make a technical contribution in the form of a new algorithm or AI application, not all
                      do, nor is it a requirement of the MMM conference. Do not give less value to papers that carry out studies of
                      new multimedia problems because they do not make a novel algorithmic contribution. Instead, judge these papers
                      by the novelty of their insights and the value these insights could have for the community.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text"><strong>2.
                    Support your statements:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Reviews should not just state, “It is well known that…”, but rather, they should include citations. Likewise, reviews
                      should not just state, “Important references are missing…”, but rather, they should include examples.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Reviewers should list their own references only in very rare cases when these are indeed the most relevant references for
                      the authors to refer to.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Reviews should not just state, “Authors should compare to the state of the art…”, but rather, they should cite specific
                      work (i.e., peer-reviewed references) that they feel the authors should have considered and why.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text"><strong>3.
                    Respect the authors:</strong></p>

                <li>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                    Reviews should try not address the authors directly, esp. not as “you”. (A direct address can be interpreted as an
                      affront by the reader).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    During the review process, no attempt should be made to guess the identity of the authors.</p>

                  <p>
                    Statement of novelty: What does the paper contribute? Is that contribution valuable for the multimedia research community?
                      Does the paper cover all the relevant related work, and explain how its contribution builds on the related

                      made by the paper? Are they reproducible? Have the authors released a resource, such as a data set or

                      generally also will state their commitment to correcting minor errors found during the review process during the
                      rebuttal. However, major flaws must lead to rejection, since it is not possible to confirm that the authors have
                      actually corrected major flaws successfully (i.e., the paper does not go back to the reviewers for
                      checking).</p>

                Policy on arXiv papers: We consider a “publication” to be a manuscript that has undergone peer review and has been accepted
                  for publication. This means that the following points apply to arXiv papers (and any other papers available online
                  that have not been peer reviewed):</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    If
                      the paper that you are reviewing is available on arXiv, and has not been published elsewhere, it is an
                      acceptable submission to MMM, since arXiv papers are not peer reviewed and are not considered to be
                      publications;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Please do not insist that the authors cite a paper that is only on arXiv and has not otherwise been published. Since
                      arXiv papers are not all peer-reviewed publications, missing an arXiv paper does *not* count as missing related
                      work;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Likewise, if the authors do not compare their work with an approach described in an arXiv paper, it does *not* count as a
                      weakness in their experimental evaluation;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    If you know of an interesting arXiv paper relevant to the paper you are reviewing, you are more than welcome to
                      tell the authors about it, but make sure you mark the reference as FYI “for your information” so that the
                      authors know that you do not regard it as missing related work.</p>
