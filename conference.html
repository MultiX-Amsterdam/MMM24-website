            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              <img class="image image-wrap-text-custom max-width-200" src="img/anna.jpg">Visual Analytics wants to foster the strengths of humans and computers effectively through the combination of automatic data analysis methods, visualization, and interaction. Visual analytics is an extension of machine learning methods. It is also a complement to the already existing visualization techniques by the introduction of the concepts of reasoning and machine learning. Machine learning has
              successfully developed models that outperform humans in several tasks. However, this success is limited when it comes to increasing knowledge, and providing new understanding based on new data. Humans uniquely understand the world through intuition, common sense, creativity, and emotion, capabilities that are required for many multi-faceted tasks. In this talk, I will present our work and my view on embedding the human in the loop in the machine learning context through the
              concepts of visual analytics. In particular, we focus on data exploration, and hypothesis generation relying on dimensionality reduction methods as an effective visual analytics component for large high-dimensional data. Furthermore, I will discuss the promise, challenges, and current research in visual analytics to open the black box of machine learning models.

            <hr>

              <img class="image image-wrap-text-custom max-width-200" src="img/cees.jpeg">
              Multimodal foundation models are a revolutionary class of AI models that provide impressive abilities to generate multimedia content and do so by interactive prompts in a seemingly creative manner.
              These foundation models are often self-supervised transformer-based models pre-trained on large volumes of data, typically collected from the web.
              They already form the basis of all state-of-the-art systems in computer vision and natural language processing across a wide range of tasks and have shown impressive transfer learning abilities.
              Despite their immense potential, these foundation models face challenges in fundamental perception tasks such as spatial grounding and temporal reasoning, have difficulty to operate on low-resource scenarios, and neglect human-alignment for ethical, legal, and societal acceptance.
              In this talk I will highlight recent work from my lab that identifies several of these challenges as well as ways to update foundation models to address these challenges and to do so in a sustainable way, without the need to retrain from scratch.

              The brain is a unique system, in that its dynamics have a clear
              function: making its owner respond to the world around it. In order to
              perform this function, the brain continuously processes information. How
              do the dynamics of neurons and networks result in information
              processing? The physical structure of the brain (its "hardware") shapes
              this information processing and vice versa: the computations needed for
              information processing (the "software") are adapted to the physical
              structure of the hardware. Here, I will discuss this relationship
              between information processing and neural properties on different
              levels, from single neurons to networks, and from different
              perspectives, from single cell electrophysiology to network modelling.

              <b>Fleur Zeldenrust</b> started studying physics, but switched to neuroscience
              during her master's degree. She obtained a PhD in computational
              neuroscience in 2012, from the University of Amsterdam, supervised by
              Wytse Wadman. After performing postdoctoral research at the École
              Normale Supérieure in Paris with Boris Gutkin and Sophie Denève, she
              returned to the Netherlands to design a bachelour track in computational
              neuroscience in the Psychobiology BSc degree at the University of
              Amsterdam. An NWO Veni grant (2015) and later a Marie Curie Training
              Network grant (2019, 'SmartNets') allowed her to start her own research
              group at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour of the
              Radboud University in Nijmegen. She recently obtained an NWO Vidi grant
              to research the influence of neuromodulators on information processing
              in the brain. Next to her research, she is very passionate about
              communicating neuroscience to the public, (co-)founding amongst others
              the Dutch Brain Olympiad and the BrainHelpDesk.
