              Special sessions at MMM 2024 will focus on state-of-the-art research directions within the multimedia field.
              Special session papers, which can be invited or submitted, will supplement the regular research papers and be included in the proceedings of the conference.
              Special sessions should generally be organized in a panel format, where the authors have reduced time to present their work, followed by an extensive Q&A session with the audience.
              This has been shown to work well in recent editions of MMM.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              The panel format is a general guideline rather than a strict requirement.
              If a proposal envisages a potential for a large number of submissions, or if particular value may be provided by the additional discussions that could come with the format of longer workshop activities, we are open to such a submission and would negotiate it further.
            </p>
            <h2>Special Session Submission Process</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              Normally, each special session will include four to five papers.
              In addition to invited papers, if any, the conference will also welcome open submissions to special sessions.
              In order to ensure the high quality of accepted papers, all papers submitted to special sessions, including invited papers, will be peer-reviewed through a strict review process.
              If a special session has many high-quality submissions, some of the submissions might be moved to regular sessions.
              The review process will be coordinated with the main technical program review process of the MMM, as coordinated by the PC chairs.
              The organizers of each special session must provide 1-2 reviews per submitted / invited paper, while the regular program committee will provide another two reviews.
              Final decision on acceptance / rejection will be made jointly by the special session chairs and the MMM 2024 PC chairs.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Special session papers must follow the same guidelines as regular research papers with respect to restrictions on formatting, length, and double-blind reviews.
            </p>
