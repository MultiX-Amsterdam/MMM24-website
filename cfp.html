            <p class="text">Special sessions at MMM 2024 will focus on state-of-the-art research directions within the multimedia field. Special session papers, which can be invited or submitted, will supplement the regular research papers and be included in the proceedings of the conference. Special sessions should generally be organized in a panel format, where the authors have reduced time to present their work, followed by an extensive Q&A session with the audience. This has been shown to work well in recent editions of MMM.</p>

            <p class="text">The panel format is a general guideline rather than a strict requirement. If a proposal envisages a potential for a large number of submissions, or if particular value may be provided by the additional discussions that could come with the format of longer workshop activities, we are open to such a submission and would negotiate it further.</p>

<h2>Special Session Submission Process</h2>

<p class="text">Normally, each special session will include four to five papers. In addition to invited papers, if any, the conference will also welcome open submissions to special sessions. In order to ensure the high quality of accepted papers, all papers submitted to special sessions, including invited papers, will be peer-reviewed through a strict review process. If a special session has many high-quality submissions, some of the submissions might be moved to regular sessions. 
The review process will be coordinated with the main technical program review process of the MMM, as coordinated by the PC chairs. The organizers of each special session must provide 1-2 reviews per submitted / invited paper, while the regular program committee will provide another two reviews. Final decision on acceptance / rejection will be made jointly by the special session chairs and the MMM 2024 PC chairs.</p>

<p class="text">Special session papers must follow the same guidelines as regular research papers with respect to restrictions on formatting, length, and double-blind reviews.</p>

<h2>Special Session Proposal Guidelines</h2>

<p class="text">Please include the following information in your proposal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Title of the proposed special session.</li>
  <li>Name, affiliation, brief biography and contact information for each of the organizers.</li>
  <li>A session abstract including significance justification and a brief overview of the state-of-the-art of the proposed special session topic.</li>
  <li>List of invited papers, if applicable, including for each paper: tentative title, author list, and preferably a short abstract.</li>
  <li>Proposal for arrangement of the reviews from session organizers (e.g. list of reviewers for the special session).</li>
  <li>Description of the session format (e.g. panel, technical talks, poster session).</li>
  <li>Plans for advertising the special session (e.g. targeted distribution lists, projects, communities)</li>
  <li>If applicable, plans for exploitation of the results of the workshop (e.g. summary papers)</li>
</ul>

<p class="text">Proposals will be evaluated based on the timeliness of the topic and relevance to MMM, anticipated quality of papers in the proposed session and the other information from the list above provided by the organisers.</p>

<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
